[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:13 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findfunctions.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "functions", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "functions" with
  any of the following names:

    functionsConfig.cmake
    functions-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "functions" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "functions_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "functions" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
